### Installation

#### CocoaPods

We use CocoaPods as our package manager. In order to install you will need
a working version of
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

To install CocoaPods, assuming you're in the TextCrunch root:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
pod install
```
**Important:** Open the project using TextCrunch.xcworkspace via xCode
otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.

If this all worked successfully, you'll have all of the latest dependecies
installed and working properly!


#### Development

You can modify and run the app by cloning this repository and then opening the project within XCode(v6.1 required).
